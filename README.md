#MathGame 

A barebones game focusing on arithmetic expressions and problems for grade 1-4. Mainly made it for nephews to improve their grades in school.
Further updates will be made depending on their progression or if i have some free time.

To do:
Multiple operations at once.
Expression involving more than 2 operands at once.
Find the variable x-type of expressions.
Maybe some geometry stuff.
